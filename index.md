**Academic Projects**

Quantifying Viewer Engagement through Facial Mood Detection

The project aims to detect audience engagement by capturing their facial expressions and identifying their mood, 
allowing speaker to get feedback on audience’s experience. The project utilizes a recent and highly accurate facial 
expression recognition method called "Facial Expression Recognition in the Wild via Deep Attentive Center Loss" 
which uses the Deep Attentive Center Loss (DACL) method to better tackle the FER problem. The project has the 
potential to identify emotions from images taken in non-ideal or laboratory scenarios and could be useful in virtual 
settings where speakers lack feedback on audience engagement.

Exploring the Role of Networks in Predicting and Improving Social Mobility

Interested in contributing to the ongoing conversation on decreasing rates of intergenerational betterment in the 
United States, the project explores the role of social networks in promoting upward economic mobility. The project 
utilizes data on zip code-wise connectedness to develop a network between zip codes to explore the relationships 
between economic connectedness and social mobility. By analyzing the Socio-Economic Status (SES) and 
connectedness of communities, we investigate how high economic connectedness and high PageRank communities 
can contribute to higher rates of social mobility
