# From an aspiring data scientist!

## About me
After gaining nearly 6 years of experience at Cisco Systems as both a Software Engineer and a Network Consulting Engineer, I made the decision to embark on a new career path as a Data Scientist. My previous roles have provided me with a solid foundation to comprehend the comprehensive operations of a company and equipped me with the technical acumen necessary to execute tasks efficiently. However, it is my deep-seated yearning to harness the power of data and artificial intelligence in order to enhance people's lives that has propelled me towards this field.

I firmly believe in the captivating nature and effectiveness of compelling storytelling, and I consistently prioritize presenting information in an engaging manner. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at Indiana University, Bloomington, where I am further honing my skills and knowledge in this dynamic field.

## Academic Projects

1. Quantifying Viewer Engagement through Facial Mood Detection

   The project aims to detect audience engagement by capturing their facial expressions and identifying their mood, allowing the speaker to get feedback on the audience's experience. The project utilizes a recent and highly accurate facial expression recognition method called "Facial Expression Recognition in the Wild via Deep Attentive Center Loss," which uses the Deep Attentive Center Loss (DACL) method to better tackle the FER problem. The project has the potential to identify emotions from images taken in non-ideal or laboratory scenarios and could be useful in virtual settings where speakers lack feedback on audience engagement.

2. Exploring the Role of Networks in Predicting and Improving Social Mobility

   Interested in contributing to the ongoing conversation on decreasing rates of intergenerational betterment in the United States, the project explores the role of social networks in promoting upward economic mobility. The project utilizes data on zip code-wise connectedness to develop a network between zip codes to explore the relationships between economic connectedness and social mobility. By analyzing the Socio-Economic Status (SES) and connectedness of communities, we investigate how high economic connectedness and high PageRank communities
